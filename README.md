# Dungeons & Dragons (2e) Spellbook

This app is designed for Dungeons & Dragons players and Dungeon masters alike! It is a compilation database for wizard and priest class spells using AD&D 2e version rules. Users can open the spellbook and uncover the mystic details of all the spells in the game. Users can also make edits, remove spells, and add User-created spells to it's pages!

## Future Enhancements

* In the future, I'd like to add in some authentication/authorization features, so that only the Dungeon master/Game Master can made edits and remove spells, while players can simply view the spell details and create new ones.
